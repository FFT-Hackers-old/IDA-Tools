# IDA-Sync

IDA-Sync is a small plugin that allow exporting and importing workspace annotations.  
It is useful in situations where sharing the whole IDA database would be impractical, and is well suited for version control.

## Installation

Simply copy `ida-sync.py` into the plugins folder of your IDA installation.
IDA-Sync requires IDA 7 or higher.

## Usage

IDA-Sync adds two menu options, under `File/Produce file` and `File/Load file`, to export and import JSON data.
